  - Memory usage monitoring (RSS, VMS, percentages)
  - Network connection monitoring (status breakdown, CLOSE_WAIT detection)
  - Disk usage monitoring with threshold warnings
  - Automated resource leak warning system
  - Service health monitoring with connection validation
  - `psutil` integration for system-level resource tracking

### Issue #6: Import-Time vs Runtime Initialization âœ… **RESOLVED**
- **Status**: 100% Complete
- **Implementation**: Lazy initialization patterns throughout
- **Features**:
  - AuthService lazy initialization with `get_auth_service()` factory
  - Agent Registry lazy initialization with on-demand agent creation
  - OrchestratorAgent property-based lazy loading
  - Removal of import-time initialization from all critical services
  - Proper separation of import-time vs runtime initialization
