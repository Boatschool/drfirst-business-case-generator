## ðŸ“‹ General Instructions

### Rating Scale (1-5)
- **5 - Excellent**: Exceptional quality, exceeds professional standards
- **4 - Good**: High quality with minor improvements needed
- **3 - Average**: Acceptable, meets basic requirements
- **2 - Poor**: Below average, significant issues
- **1 - Very Poor**: Unacceptable, major problems

### Evaluation Process
1. Review input and expected characteristics from golden dataset
2. Examine agent output completely
3. Apply rubrics for each applicable human metric
4. Provide scores (1-5) and explanatory comments
5. Give overall assessment
