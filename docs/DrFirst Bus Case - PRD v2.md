# **Product Requirements Document (PRD) \- V2**

## **1\. Product Name**

DrFirst Agentic Business Case Generator (Internal Codename: "Project Catalyst" \- *optional placeholder*)

## **2\. Overview**

An internally-focused, agent-powered platform for DrFirst teams to automatically generate, refine, and evaluate business cases for software development projects. The system utilizes a coordinated ensemble of generative AI agents to draft PRDs, system designs, cost estimates, and revenue/value forecasts. It emphasizes robust Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) collaboration through well-defined Agent-to-UI (AG-UI) interaction points and leverages Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication for efficient workflow execution. The platform aims to streamline project initiation and justification within DrFirst, supporting multi-party coordination (akin to MCP principles) between users and various AI agents.

## **3\. Goals**

* Enable DrFirst business, product, and sales teams to easily initiate and define software project requests.  
* Utilize AI agents, communicating via A2A protocols and orchestrated effectively, to autonomously generate initial drafts of Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), technical system designs, development effort breakdowns, cost estimates, and revenue/value forecasts relevant to DrFirst's strategic objectives.  
* Apply configurable cost models (via DrFirst internal rate cards) and revenue/value projection templates (aligned with DrFirst pricing and impact models) to ensure consistency and realism.  
* Provide DrFirst administrators with tools to manage internal approval routing logic, user roles, rate cards, and pricing/value inputs.  
* Allow DrFirst teams to export approved business cases as PDFs or shareable links for wider internal dissemination and record-keeping, potentially linking to **Confluence** pages or **SharePoint** repositories.  
* Support projects of varying scales relevant to DrFirst's portfolio, initially focusing on minor enhancements to medium-sized new features.

## **4\. Project Initiation & Intake**

The process begins when a DrFirst team member initiates a new project request. The system will guide them through an initial conversational intake (an AG-UI interaction) to capture the core idea:

* **Initial Prompt:** The user will provide a natural language description of the business problem, desired outcome, or feature idea.  
* **Guided Questions (via Conversational AI):** The system's intake agent will ask clarifying questions.  
* **Minimum Viable Input:** The system will aim to gather enough information for the product\_manager\_agent to draft an initial PRD.  
* **Existing Document/Link Upload (Optional):** Users can optionally upload existing internal DrFirst documents or provide links to relevant **Confluence** pages, **SharePoint** documents, or **Jira** epics/stories that the agents can use as source material. The system will acknowledge the importance of these existing artifacts in the agent's context.

## **5\. Core Features**

* **Conversational & Interactive UI (AG-UI Focus):** For initial project intake, providing feedback during HITL review stages, and receiving updates from agents. The UI will clearly delineate AI-generated content from user edits.  
* **AI Agent Orchestration & A2A Communication:** A central orchestrator manages a team of specialized AI agents. These agents will communicate and pass structured data/artifacts amongst themselves (A2A protocols) to coordinate the multi-step business case generation process efficiently.  
* **Multi-Party Coordination Protocol (MCP) for Workflow Management:** The system will implement coordination mechanisms to ensure consistent state and progression as multiple agents and human users interact with the business case components over its lifecycle. This includes managing dependencies between tasks (e.g., PRD completion before system design).  
* **Iterative Document Generation with HITL Review:**  
  * **Draft & Review Cycles:** Key documents are first drafted by AI agents.  
  * **User Editing & Feedback:** Relevant DrFirst personnel can directly review, edit, and comment on drafts via the UI.  
  * **Agent Revision:** Users can request agents to revise sections based on specific feedback, triggering further A2A or AG-UI interactions.  
* **Cost Calculation:** Utilizes editable, DrFirst-specific role-based rate cards.  
* **Revenue/Value Projection:** Generates forecasts based on configurable DrFirst templates.  
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).**  
* **Configurable Approval Workflow.**  
* **Admin Dashboard.**  
* **Export & Sharing:** With potential for structured data export suitable for future integration with tools like **Jira**.

## **6\. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Workflow**

Collaboration between AI agents and DrFirst experts, facilitated by clear AG-UI touchpoints and managed under an MCP framework:

1. **PRD Review:** Initiating DrFirst user and relevant Product Owner/Manager review, edit, and approve the PRD.  
2. **System Design & Effort Estimation Review:** DrFirst Developers or Tech Leads review.  
3. **Financial/Value Model Review:** Relevant DrFirst stakeholders review.  
4. **Final Business Case Approval:** Through a formal DrFirst internal approval flow.

**Collaboration Mechanisms:** Direct editing, commenting, agent re-prompting (AG-UI interactions triggering agent processing).

## **7\. User Roles (Examples within DrFirst)**

* **Business/Product User (Initiator).**  
* **Technical Reviewer (Developer/Architect).**  
* **Admin.**  
* **Approver (Manager/Director/VP).**  
* **(Optional) SME.**

## **8\. Scope & Scale of Projects**

Focuses on internal DrFirst software development projects.

## **9\. Assumptions**

* Users are DrFirst employees.  
* DrFirst Admins maintain inputs.  
* LLMs have sufficient general knowledge, augmented by DrFirst context. The AG-UI intake process is key for gathering this context.  
* DrFirst personnel engage in HITL.  
* Access to DrFirst internal systems (including **Jira**, **Confluence**, **SharePoint** APIs for future integrations) will be managed appropriately.

## **10\. Constraints**

* Initial focus on DrFirst software development projects.  
* Accuracy depends on inputs and HITL.  
* Agents augment, not replace, DrFirst expertise.  
* Hosted on GCP, adhering to DrFirst policies.  
* Complete web application for intake and business case management.  
* The effectiveness of A2A and MCP implementations will depend on clear API definitions and state management between agents.

## **11\. Success Metrics**

* **Rapid Initial Draft Generation:** \< 5 minutes (agent processing).  
* **Reduced Manual Effort:** Reduce internal DrFirst planning time by at least 70%.  
* **Faster Approval Turnaround:** \< 24 business hours (DrFirst internal).  
* **User Adoption within DrFirst.**  
* **Internal User Satisfaction.**  
* **Seamless Agent Collaboration:** Qualitative feedback indicating that the A2A and MCP aspects result in a smooth, coherent experience rather than disjointed agent outputs.

## **12\. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Usability:** Intuitive AG-UI.  
* **Performance.**  
* **Scalability.**  
* **Availability.**  
* **Security:** (Includes RBAC, encryption, DrFirst SSO, compliance with DrFirst IT/HIPAA policies). The MCP design should also consider security aspects of data sharing between agents if they operate in different trust domains (though likely less of an issue in a fully internal system).  
* **Maintainability:** Modular agent logic (A2A interfaces should be stable), Admin-configurable elements.  
* **Extensibility (Future):** Architecture allowing new agents and integrations (e.g., richer A2A communication, deeper **Jira**/**Confluence** integration).

## **13\. Out of Scope for Initial Release (V1) / Future Considerations**

**Out of Scope for V1:**

* **Advanced AI Model Fine-tuning on DrFirst Proprietary Data.**  
* **Direct Bi-directional API Integration with DrFirst's JIRA/Azure DevOps/Confluence/SharePoint:** V1 will focus on agent generation and user export. Link sharing and file uploads are supported. Deeper integrations (e.g., auto-creating JIRA tickets from approved cases, pulling status back from Jira) are future.  
* **Automated Generation of Marketing Copy or External Client-Facing Documents.**  
* **Multi-language Support.**  
* **Complex, Dynamic "What-if" Scenario Modeling.**  
* **Mobile-Specific Application Interface.**  
* **Formalized, mathematically provable MCP guarantees:** While principles of coordination will be used, rigorous formal verification of multi-party protocols is out of scope for V1.

**Future Considerations (Post-V1):**

* The items listed above.  
* Deeper, bi-directional integrations with **Jira**, **Confluence**, and **SharePoint**.  
* Agent learning from DrFirst HITL feedback.  
* Advanced analytics on DrFirst business case trends.  
* Support for other types of DrFirst internal business cases.  
* Exploring more advanced A2A negotiation or collaborative problem-solving protocols.

## **14\. Ethical AI & Responsible Use within DrFirst**

* **Transparency (AG-UI):** UI will clearly indicate AI-generated content.  
* **Human Oversight & Accountability (HITL).**  
* **Bias Mitigation.**  
* **Data Privacy & Confidentiality:** All inputs/outputs are DrFirst proprietary. No DrFirst confidential data used to train external models. A2A communication will occur within DrFirst's secure environment.  
* **Auditability:** System logs agent actions (A2A steps, AG-UI interactions) and user modifications.

## **15\. User Onboarding & Support (for DrFirst Teams)**

* **Intuitive Design.**  
* **In-App Guidance.**  
* **DrFirst Internal Documentation:** Quick start guides, FAQs, video tutorials on **Confluence** or DrFirst's learning platform.
