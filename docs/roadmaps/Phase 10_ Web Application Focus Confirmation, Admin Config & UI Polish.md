**Phase 10: Web Application Focus Confirmation, Admin Config & UI Polish**

* **Focus:** Confirm and solidify the web application as the sole primary interface by performing audit-driven cleanup. Implement basic admin configuration for final approvals. Then, polish the web application's usability, intake flow, and review initial deployment considerations.  
* **Prerequisite:** Task 10.0 (Codebase Audit for Web Application Focus) is COMPLETE, and its summary report is available.  
* **Status:** Audit cleanup tasks (10.0.1, 10.0.2) COMPLETE âœ…. New Case Creation workflow (10.1.1-10.1.3) COMPLETE âœ…. Remaining tasks todo unless otherwise specified.
